This repository contains the time tracking dashboard from Frontend Mentor.

I've tried to make it look like the original one. Used vanilla js, SCSS and html to create the layout and login. Data is fetched from data.json file and not hardcoded.

I've decided to sprinkle some interactivity into this excersise by adding dialog window (modal) on each of the card that contains all the data - daily, weekly and monthly for this type of activity.

You can open it with github pages: https://jkuba61.github.io/Time-Tracking-Dashboard/
